### Algorithms-Part-I Interview Questions

- [Merging with smaller auxiliary array](src/MergeWithSmallerAux.java)

    Suppose that the subarray a[0] to a[n−1] is sorted and the subarray a[n] to a[2∗n−1] is sorted. How can you merge the two subarrays so that a[0] to a[2∗n−1] is sorted using an auxiliary array of length n (instead of 2n)?

- [Counting inversions](src/CountInversion.java)
  
    An inversion in an array a[] is a pair of entries a[i] and a[j] 
    such that i<j but a[i]>a[j]. Given an array, 
    design a linearithmic algorithm to count the number of inversions.

- [Shuffling a linked list](/src/ShuffleLinkedList.java)

    Given a singly-linked list containing n items, rearrange the items uniformly at random. Your algorithm should consume a logarithmic (or constant) amount of extra memory and run in time proportional to nlogn in the worst case.
